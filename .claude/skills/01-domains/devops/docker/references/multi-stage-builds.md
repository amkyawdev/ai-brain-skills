# Multi-Stage Builds

## Node.js Example

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Python Example

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN python -m venv /opt/venv
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Production stage
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /opt/venv /opt/venv
ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Best Practices

1. Use specific version tags
2. Minimize layers
3. Order instructions by change frequency
4. Use .dockerignore
5. Don't run as root
